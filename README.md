# ETL Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains a production-grade ETL pipeline designed to automate extraction, transformation, validation, and loading of Demand Planning data into SQL Server.

The system integrates:

- **Power BI Semantic Models (ADOMD.NET + DAX)**
- **Python (Pandas)**
- **SQL Server (pyodbc)**

The automation reduced manual reporting time from 5–6 hours to ~30 minutes and eliminated repetitive analyst intervention.
